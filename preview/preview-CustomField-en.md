In a world of "one size fits all" software, **Beebole Custom Fields** are your secret weapon for tailoring project tracking to your specific business DNA.

## Why Use Custom Fields?

Standard time tracking tells you **who** worked and for **how long**. Custom fields tell you **why**, **how**, and **under what conditions**.

* **Granular Reporting:** Group and filter reports by unique criteria like "Department," "Grant ID," or "Task Urgency."
* **Workflow Integration:** Link Beebole data to your ERP or CRM by adding external Reference IDs.
* **Compliance & Billing:** Track whether hours are "Billable," "R&D Tax Credit Eligible," or "Overtime" with a simple dropdown.

## Pro-Tips for Implementation

1.  **Keep it Simple:** Only make fields "Required" if the data is essential for your payroll or invoicing.
2.  **Use Dropdowns:** Avoid "Text" fields where possible to prevent typos (e.g., "Marketing" vs "Mktg") from ruining your reports.
3.  **Entity Mapping:** You can attach custom fields to **Projects**, **Tasks**, or even **Users** for maximum flexibility.
