### Key Advantages of Tracking Costs

* **Real-Time Margin Analysis:** Instantly see the difference between your billable rates and internal labor costs.
* **Budget Precision:** Prevent project overruns by monitoring spend against your initial estimates in real-time.
* **Customizable Cost Rates:** Set specific hourly costs for different employees, departments, or specialized roles.
* **Historical Accuracy:** Audit past projects with precision to ensure your future bids are both competitive and profitable.

### How to Implement Cost Tracking

1. **Define Your Rates:** Input internal labor costs for each team member within their user profile.
2. **Log Time as Usual:** Have your team track hours against specific customers, projects or tasks.
3. **Run Profitability Reports:** Generate instant reports to visualize the "Cost vs. Revenue" breakdown for any given period.
